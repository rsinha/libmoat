1. implement multiple ocalls within recv(), so that recv() only returns when all requested bytes are available
   similarly, implement buffering within recv(); so if we fetched extra bytes, they can be returned in a later call to recv
2. implement session renegotiation after IV wrap around
3. Module-specific initialization routine e.g. list = null in attestation
4. Bi-directional channels to allow consecutive send and consecutive read operations

Future Work
1. Concurrent
