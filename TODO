Bug Fixes
1. implement session renegotiation after IV wrap around
2. Implement file system re-encryption after IV wrap around
3. error codes and error messages (print them in debug mode)

Future Work
1. Asynchronous Ocalls, concurrent User threads
2. implement remote attestation
3. implement an attestation authority
4. Side channel protections: timing, access patterns
  - Path ORAM for obliviating file access pattern
  - Constant message sizes, and round robin sends for obliviating I/O traffic
  - all observable I/O events should be periodic for hiding timing leaks
