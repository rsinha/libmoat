These are the code samples contained in the Digital Random Number
Generator Software Implementation Guide, along with some supplementary
utilities and binaries that demonstrate their use. They are designed
for the Linux and OS X environment, and compile with gcc.

They will build and run on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems, though 64-bit
random values and seeds will not be produced on 32-bit architectures.

To build the samples, run:

   % ./configure
   % make

This will create the following binaries (assuming all build dependancies
are met):

   testdrng - A program that generates random numbers and seeds using
   the sample functions in drng.c. It calls both the RDRAND and the
   RDSEED instructions if your CPU supports them.

   rdrand128 - Generates a 128-bit random value from two 64-bit RDRANDs
   (or four 32-bit RDRANDs, if in 32-bit mode) that are cryptographically
   mixed using HMAC_SHA256. To build this sample you must have the
   libgcrypt headers and libraries installed on your system.

   seed_from_rdrand - Generates random seeds from the RDRAND instruction
   using the CBC-MAC procedure described in the Software Implementation
   Guide. To build this sample you must have the libgcrypt headers and
   libraries installed on your system.

If the libgcrypt headers and libraries are not present on your system
then the rdrand128 and seed_from_rdrand binaries will be skipped.
